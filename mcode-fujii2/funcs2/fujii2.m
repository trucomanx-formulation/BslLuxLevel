function [Y] = fujii2(DATA,varargin)
%
%  This function implements the Fujii Technique [1]. Use as
%  input data a 3D matrix created grouping NTIMES intensity matrices I(k)
%  1<=k<=NTIMES
%
%  I(k)=DATA(:,:,k)
%
%  $FUJII=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{NTIMES-1} \frac{|I(k)-I(k+1)|}{I(k)+I(k+1)+eps}$
%
%  The function is normalized to:
%
%  $Y=FUJII \frac{200}{NTIMES-1}$
%
%  Where (NTIMES-1) is the number of elements in the sum, 2 is a factor to
%  to do $(I(k)+I(k+1))/2$, a mean value, and 100 is a percentage factor.
%  Thus the Y matrix represents the expected percentage value of absolute difference 
%  $|I(k)-I(k+1)|$ relative to the mean value $(I(k)+I(k+1))/2$ for any two 
%  consecutive values.
%
%  $Y \approx 100*E[\frac{|I(k)-I(k+1)|}{(I(k)+I(k+1))/2}]$

%
%
%  After starting the main routine just type the following command at the
%  prompt:
%  Y = fujii(DATA);
%  
%  Input:
%  DATA is the speckle data pack. Where DATA is a 3D matrix created grouping NTIMES 
%       intensity matrices with NLIN lines and NCOL columns. When N=size(DATA), then
%       N(1,1) represents NLIN and
%       N(1,2) represents NCOL and
%       N(1,3) represents NTIMES.
%  SHOW [Optional] If SHOW is equal to the string 'off', then do not plot the result.
%
%  Output:
%  Y   returns the Fujii matrix.
