* The results of analysis show the influence of the illumination level in the value of some dynamic laser speckle indexes.
* The temporal speckle deviation index shows less influence of illumination level in high frequency bands of speckle signal. 
* The research shows the importance of select a specific illumination level and frequency band to have results with repeatability.
