* We show the influence of the illumination in the value of some speckle indexes.
* The STD index shows less influence of illumination level in high frequency bands.
* Some index like Fujii has non-linear behavior in a frequency bands analysis.
* We show the importance of select a specific illumination level and frequency band.
* Speckle index dynamic range is related to the frequency band in the speckle signal.
